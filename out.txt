processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT I
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE I	King Lear's palace.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
processElement:	Albany than Cornwall.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
processElement:	division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
processElement:	the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
processElement:	weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
processElement:	of either's moiety.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Is not this your son, my lord?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
processElement:	so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
processElement:	brazed to it.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I cannot conceive you.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
processElement:	she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
processElement:	for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
processElement:	Do you smell a fault?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
processElement:	being so proper.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
processElement:	elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
processElement:	though this knave came something saucily into the
processElement:	world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
processElement:	fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
processElement:	whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
processElement:	noble gentleman, Edmund?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	No, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
processElement:	honourable friend.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	My services to your lordship.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I must love you, and sue to know you better.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Sir, I shall study deserving.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
processElement:	again. The king is coming.
processElement:
processElement:	[Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
processElement:	GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I shall, my liege.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
processElement:	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
processElement:	In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
processElement:	To shake all cares and business from our age;
processElement:	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
processElement:	Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
processElement:	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
processElement:	We have this hour a constant will to publish
processElement:	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
processElement:	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
processElement:	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
processElement:	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
processElement:	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
processElement:	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
processElement:	Interest of territory, cares of state,--
processElement:	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
processElement:	That we our largest bounty may extend
processElement:	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
processElement:	Our eldest-born, speak first.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
processElement:	Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
processElement:	Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
processElement:	No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
processElement:	As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
processElement:	A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
processElement:	Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
processElement:	Love, and be silent.
processElement:
processElement:LEAR	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
processElement:	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
processElement:	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
processElement:	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
processElement:	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
processElement:	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Sir, I am made
processElement:	Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
processElement:	And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
processElement:	I find she names my very deed of love;
processElement:	Only she comes too short: that I profess
processElement:	Myself an enemy to all other joys,
processElement:	Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
processElement:	And find I am alone felicitate
processElement:	In your dear highness' love.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	Ay, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
processElement:	Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
processElement:	I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
processElement:	And bring some covering for this naked soul,
processElement:	Who I'll entreat to lead me.
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	Alack, sir, he is mad.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
processElement:	Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
processElement:	Above the rest, be gone.
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
processElement:	Come on't what will.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, naked fellow,--
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.
processElement:
processElement:	[Aside]
processElement:
processElement:	I cannot daub it further.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Come hither, fellow.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Know'st thou the way to Dover?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
processElement:	Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
processElement:	thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
processElement:	fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
processElement:	Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
processElement:	stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
processElement:	mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
processElement:	and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
processElement:	Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
processElement:	Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
processElement:	Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
processElement:	That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
processElement:	Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
processElement:	So distribution should undo excess,
processElement:	And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Ay, master.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
processElement:	Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
processElement:	Bring me but to the very brim of it,
processElement:	And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
processElement:	With something rich about me: from that place
processElement:	I shall no leading need.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Give me thy arm:
processElement:	Poor Tom shall lead thee.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	KING LEAR
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT IV
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE II	Before ALBANY's palace.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GONERIL and EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
processElement:	Not met us on the way.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:		 Now, where's your master'?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Madam, within; but never man so changed.
processElement:	I told him of the army that was landed;
processElement:	He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
processElement:	His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
processElement:	And of the loyal service of his son,
processElement:	When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
processElement:	And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
processElement:	What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
processElement:	What like, offensive.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
processElement:	It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
processElement:	That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
processElement:	Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
processElement:	May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
processElement:	Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
processElement:	I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
processElement:	Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
processElement:	Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
processElement:	If you dare venture in your own behalf,
processElement:	A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
processElement:
processElement:	[Giving a favour]
processElement:
processElement:	Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
processElement:	Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
processElement:	Conceive, and fare thee well.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Yours in the ranks of death.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	My most dear Gloucester!
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:	O, the difference of man and man!
processElement:	To thee a woman's services are due:
processElement:	My fool usurps my body.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Madam, here comes my lord.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter ALBANY]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	I have been worth the whistle.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	O Goneril!
processElement:	You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
processElement:	Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
processElement:	That nature, which contemns its origin,
processElement:	Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
processElement:	She that herself will sliver and disbranch
processElement:	From her material sap, perforce must wither
processElement:	And come to deadly use.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	No more; the text is foolish.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
processElement:	Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
processElement:	Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
processElement:	A father, and a gracious aged man,
processElement:	Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
processElement:	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
processElement:	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
processElement:	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
processElement:	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
processElement:	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
processElement:	It will come,
processElement:	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
processElement:	Like monsters of the deep.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Milk-liver'd man!
processElement:	That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
processElement:	Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
processElement:	Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
processElement:	Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
processElement:	Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
processElement:	France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
processElement:	With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
processElement:	Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
processElement:	'Alack, why does he so?'
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	See thyself, devil!
processElement:	Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
processElement:	So horrid as in woman.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	O vain fool!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
processElement:	Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
processElement:	To let these hands obey my blood,
processElement:	They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
processElement:	Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
processElement:	A woman's shape doth shield thee.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Marry, your manhood now--
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Messenger]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	What news?
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
processElement:	Slain by his servant, going to put out
processElement:	The other eye of Gloucester.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Gloucester's eye!
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
processElement:	Opposed against the act, bending his sword
processElement:	To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
processElement:	Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
processElement:	But not without that harmful stroke, which since
processElement:	Hath pluck'd him after.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	This shows you are above,
processElement:	You justicers, that these our nether crimes
processElement:	So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
processElement:	Lost he his other eye?
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	Both, both, my lord.
processElement:	This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
processElement:	'Tis from your sister.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	[Aside]              One way I like this well;
processElement:	But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
processElement:	May all the building in my fancy pluck
processElement:	Upon my hateful life: another way,
processElement:	The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	Come with my lady hither.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	He is not here.
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	No, my good lord; I met him back again.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Knows he the wickedness?
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
processElement:	And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
processElement:	Might have the freer course.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Gloucester, I live
processElement:	To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
processElement:	And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
processElement:	Tell me what more thou know'st.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	KING LEAR
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT IV
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE III	The French camp near Dover.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT and a Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
processElement:	know you the reason?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Something he left imperfect in the
processElement:	state, which since his coming forth is thought
processElement:	of; which imports to the kingdom so much
processElement:	fear and danger, that his personal return was
processElement:	most required and necessary.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Who hath he left behind him general?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Did your letters pierce the queen to any
processElement:	demonstration of grief?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
processElement:	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
processElement:	Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
processElement:	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
processElement:	Sought to be king o'er her.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	O, then it moved her.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
processElement:	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
processElement:	Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
processElement:	Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
processElement:	That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
processElement:	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
processElement:	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
processElement:	Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
processElement:	If all could so become it.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Made she no verbal question?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
processElement:	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
processElement:	Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
processElement:	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
processElement:	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
processElement:	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
processElement:	And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
processElement:	To deal with grief alone.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	It is the stars,
processElement:	The stars above us, govern our conditions;
processElement:	Else one self mate and mate could not beget
processElement:	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	No.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Was this before the king return'd?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	No, since.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
processElement:	Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
processElement:	What we are come about, and by no means
processElement:	Will yield to see his daughter.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Why, good sir?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
processElement:	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
processElement:	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
processElement:	To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
processElement:	His mind so venomously, that burning shame
processElement:	Detains him from Cordelia.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Alack, poor gentleman!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	'Tis so, they are afoot.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
processElement:	And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
processElement:	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
processElement:	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
processElement:	Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
processElement:	Along with me.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	hours at the trade.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
processElement:	at suit of his gray beard,--
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
processElement:	lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
processElement:	unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
processElement:	a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Peace, sirrah!
processElement:	You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Why art thou angry?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
processElement:	Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
processElement:	Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
processElement:	Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
processElement:	That in the natures of their lords rebel;
processElement:	Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
processElement:	Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
processElement:	With every gale and vary of their masters,
processElement:	Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
processElement:	A plague upon your epileptic visage!
processElement:	Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
processElement:	Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
processElement:	I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	How fell you out? say that.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No contraries hold more antipathy
processElement:	Than I and such a knave.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	His countenance likes me not.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
processElement:	I have seen better faces in my time
processElement:	Than stands on any shoulder that I see
processElement:	Before me at this instant.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	This is some fellow,
processElement:	Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
processElement:	A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
processElement:	Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
processElement:	An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
processElement:	An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
processElement:	These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
processElement:	Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
processElement:	Than twenty silly ducking observants
processElement:	That stretch their duties nicely.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
processElement:	Under the allowance of your great aspect,
processElement:	Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
processElement:	On flickering Phoebus' front,--
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	What mean'st by this?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	To go out of my dialect, which you
processElement:	discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
processElement:	flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
processElement:	accent was a plain knave; which for my part
processElement:	I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
processElement:	to entreat me to 't.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	What was the offence you gave him?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I never gave him any:
processElement:	It pleased the king his master very late
processElement:	To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
processElement:	When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
processElement:	Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
processElement:	And put upon him such a deal of man,
processElement:	That worthied him, got praises of the king
processElement:	For him attempting who was self-subdued;
processElement:	And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
processElement:	Drew on me here again.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	None of these rogues and cowards
processElement:	But Ajax is their fool.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks!
processElement:	You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
processElement:CORDELIA	[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
processElement:	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
processElement:	More richer than my tongue.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	To thee and thine hereditary ever
processElement:	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
processElement:	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
processElement:	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
processElement:	Although the last, not least; to whose young love
processElement:	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
processElement:	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
processElement:	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Nothing, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Nothing!
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Nothing.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
processElement:	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
processElement:	According to my bond; nor more nor less.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
processElement:	Lest it may mar your fortunes.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Good my lord,
processElement:	You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
processElement:	Return those duties back as are right fit,
processElement:	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
processElement:	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
processElement:	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
processElement:	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
processElement:	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
processElement:	Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
processElement:	To love my father all.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	But goes thy heart with this?
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Ay, good my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	So young, and so untender?
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	So young, my lord, and true.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
processElement:	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
processElement:	The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
processElement:	By all the operation of the orbs
processElement:	From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
processElement:	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
processElement:	Propinquity and property of blood,
processElement:	And as a stranger to my heart and me
processElement:	Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
processElement:	Or he that makes his generation messes
processElement:	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
processElement:	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
processElement:	As thou my sometime daughter.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Good my liege,--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Peace, Kent!
processElement:	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
processElement:	I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
processElement:	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
processElement:	So be my grave my peace, as here I give
processElement:	Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
processElement:	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
processElement:	With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
processElement:	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
processElement:	I do invest you jointly with my power,
processElement:	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
processElement:	That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
processElement:	With reservation of an hundred knights,
processElement:	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
processElement:	Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
processElement:	The name, and all the additions to a king;
processElement:	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
processElement:	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
processElement:	This coronet part betwixt you.
processElement:
processElement:	[Giving the crown]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Royal Lear,
processElement:	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
processElement:	Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
processElement:	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
processElement:	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
processElement:	When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
processElement:	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
processElement:	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
processElement:	When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
processElement:	And, in thy best consideration, cheque
processElement:	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
processElement:	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
processElement:	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
processElement:	Reverbs no hollowness.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Kent, on thy life, no more.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	My life I never held but as a pawn
processElement:	To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
processElement:	Thy safety being the motive.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Out of my sight!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	See better, Lear; and let me still remain
processElement:	The true blank of thine eye.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Now, by Apollo,--
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  Now, by Apollo, king,
processElement:	Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, vassal! miscreant!
processElement:
processElement:	[Laying his hand on his sword]
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	|
processElement:	|  Dear sir, forbear.
processElement:CORNWALL	|
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Do:
processElement:	Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
processElement:	Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
processElement:	Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
processElement:	I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Hear me, recreant!
processElement:	On thine allegiance, hear me!
processElement:	Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
processElement:	Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
processElement:	To come between our sentence and our power,
processElement:	Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
processElement:	Our potency made good, take thy reward.
processElement:	Five days we do allot thee, for provision
processElement:	To shield thee from diseases of the world;
processElement:	And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
processElement:	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
processElement:	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
processElement:	The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
processElement:	This shall not be revoked.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
processElement:	Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
processElement:
processElement:	[To CORDELIA]
processElement:
processElement:	The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
processElement:	That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
processElement:
processElement:	[To REGAN and GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:	And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
processElement:	That good effects may spring from words of love.
processElement:	Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
processElement:	He'll shape his old course in a country new.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:	[Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
processElement:	BURGUNDY, and Attendants]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	My lord of Burgundy.
processElement:	We first address towards you, who with this king
processElement:	Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
processElement:	Will you require in present dower with her,
processElement:	Or cease your quest of love?
processElement:
processElement:BURGUNDY	Most royal majesty,
processElement:	I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
processElement:	Nor will you tender less.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Right noble Burgundy,
processElement:	When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
processElement:	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
processElement:	If aught within that little seeming substance,
processElement:	Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
processElement:	And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
processElement:	She's there, and she is yours.
processElement:
processElement:BURGUNDY	I know no answer.
processElement:	We'll teach you--
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  Sir, I am too old to learn:
processElement:	Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
processElement:	On whose employment I was sent to you:
processElement:	You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
processElement:	Against the grace and person of my master,
processElement:	Stocking his messenger.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
processElement:	There shall he sit till noon.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
processElement:	You should not use me so.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Sir, being his knave, I will.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	This is a fellow of the self-same colour
processElement:	Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
processElement:
processElement:	[Stocks brought out]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
processElement:	His fault is much, and the good king his master
processElement:	Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
processElement:	Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
processElement:	For pilferings and most common trespasses
processElement:	Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
processElement:	That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
processElement:	Should have him thus restrain'd.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I'll answer that.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	My sister may receive it much more worse,
processElement:	To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
processElement:	For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
processElement:
processElement:	[KENT is put in the stocks]
processElement:
processElement:	Come, my good lord, away.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
processElement:	Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
processElement:	Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
processElement:	Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
processElement:	A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
processElement:	Give you good morrow!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Good king, that must approve the common saw,
processElement:	Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
processElement:	To the warm sun!
processElement:	Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
processElement:	That by thy comfortable beams I may
processElement:	Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
processElement:	But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
processElement:	Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
processElement:	Of my obscured course; and shall find time
processElement:	From this enormous state, seeking to give
processElement:	Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
processElement:	Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
processElement:	This shameful lodging.
processElement:	Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!

processElement:ACT II
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE III	A wood.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I heard myself proclaim'd;
processElement:	And by the happy hollow of a tree
processElement:	Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
processElement:	That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
processElement:	Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
processElement:	I will preserve myself: and am bethought
processElement:	To take the basest and most poorest shape
processElement:	That ever penury, in contempt of man,
processElement:	Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
processElement:	Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
processElement:	And with presented nakedness out-face
processElement:	The winds and persecutions of the sky.
processElement:	The country gives me proof and precedent
processElement:	Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
processElement:	Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
processElement:	Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
processElement:	And with this horrible object, from low farms,
processElement:	Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
processElement:	Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
processElement:	Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
processElement:	That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

processElement:	KING LEAR
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT II
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE IV	Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
processElement:	And not send back my messenger.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	As I learn'd,
processElement:	The night before there was no purpose in them
processElement:	Of this remove.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  Hail to thee, noble master!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ha!
processElement:	Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
processElement:	by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
processElement:	the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
processElement:	over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
processElement:	nether-stocks.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
processElement:	To set thee here?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  It is both he and she;
processElement:	Your son and daughter.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Yes.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, I say.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I say, yea.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, no, they would not.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Yes, they have.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	By Jupiter, I swear, no.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	By Juno, I swear, ay.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	They durst not do 't;
processElement:	They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
processElement:	To do upon respect such violent outrage:
processElement:	Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
processElement:	Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
processElement:	Coming from us.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  My lord, when at their home
processElement:	I did commend your highness' letters to them,
processElement:	Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
processElement:	My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
processElement:	Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
processElement:	From Goneril his mistress salutations;
processElement:	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
processElement:	Which presently they read: on whose contents,
processElement:	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
processElement:	Commanded me to follow, and attend
processElement:	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
processElement:	And meeting here the other messenger,
processElement:	Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
processElement:	Being the very fellow that of late
processElement:	Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
processElement:	Having more man than wit about me, drew:
processElement:	He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
processElement:	Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
processElement:	The shame which here it suffers.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
processElement:	Fathers that wear rags
processElement:	Do make their children blind;
processElement:	But fathers that bear bags
processElement:	Shall see their children kind.
processElement:	Fortune, that arrant whore,
processElement:	Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
processElement:	But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
processElement:	for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
processElement:	Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
processElement:	Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	With the earl, sir, here within.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Follow me not;
processElement:	Stay here.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	None.
processElement:	How chance the king comes with so small a train?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
processElement:	question, thou hadst well deserved it.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Why, fool?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
processElement:	there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
processElement:	their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
processElement:	there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
processElement:	that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
processElement:	runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
processElement:	following it: but the great one that goes up the
processElement:	hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
processElement:	gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
processElement:	would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
processElement:	That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
processElement:	And follows but for form,
processElement:	Will pack when it begins to rain,
processElement:	And leave thee in the storm,
processElement:	But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
processElement:	And let the wise man fly:
processElement:	The knave turns fool that runs away;
processElement:	The fool no knave, perdy.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Where learned you this, fool?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Not i' the stocks, fool.
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
processElement:	They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
processElement:	The images of revolt and flying off.
processElement:	Fetch me a better answer.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	My dear lord,
processElement:	You know the fiery quality of the duke;
processElement:	How unremoveable and fix'd he is
processElement:	In his own course.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
processElement:	Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
processElement:	I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Ay, my good lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
processElement:	Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
processElement:	Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
processElement:	Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
processElement:	No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
processElement:	Infirmity doth still neglect all office
processElement:	Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
processElement:	When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
processElement:	To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
processElement:	And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
processElement:	To take the indisposed and sickly fit
processElement:	For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
processElement:
processElement:	[Looking on KENT]
processElement:
processElement:	Should he sit here? This act persuades me
processElement:	That this remotion of the duke and her
processElement:	Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
processElement:	Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
processElement:	Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
processElement:	Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
processElement:	Till it cry sleep to death.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I would have all well betwixt you.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
processElement:	when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
processElement:	o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
processElement:	wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
processElement:	kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Good morrow to you both.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Hail to your grace!
processElement:
processElement:	[KENT is set at liberty]
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I am glad to see your highness.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
processElement:	I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
processElement:	I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
processElement:	Sepulchring an adultress.
processElement:
processElement:	[To KENT]
processElement:
processElement:		    O, are you free?
processElement:	Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
processElement:	Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
processElement:	Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
processElement:
processElement:	[Points to his heart]
processElement:
processElement:	I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
processElement:	With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
processElement:	You less know how to value her desert
processElement:	Than she to scant her duty.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Say, how is that?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I cannot think my sister in the least
processElement:	Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
processElement:	She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
processElement:	'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
processElement:	As clears her from all blame.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	My curses on her!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	                  O, sir, you are old.
processElement:	Nature in you stands on the very verge
processElement:	Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
processElement:	By some discretion, that discerns your state
processElement:	Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
processElement:	That to our sister you do make return;
processElement:	Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ask her forgiveness?
processElement:	Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
processElement:	'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
processElement:
processElement:	[Kneeling]
processElement:
processElement:	Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
processElement:	That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
processElement:	Return you to my sister.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	[Rising]  Never, Regan:
processElement:	She hath abated me of half my train;
processElement:	Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
processElement:	Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
processElement:	All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
processElement:	On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
processElement:	You taking airs, with lameness!
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Fie, sir, fie!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
processElement:	Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
processElement:	You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
processElement:	To fall and blast her pride!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
processElement:	When the rash mood is on.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
processElement:	Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
processElement:	Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
processElement:	Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
processElement:	To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
processElement:	To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
processElement:	And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
processElement:	Against my coming in: thou better know'st
processElement:	The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
processElement:	Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
processElement:	Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
processElement:	Wherein I thee endow'd.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Good sir, to the purpose.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Who put my man i' the stocks?
processElement:
processElement:	[Tucket within]
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	What trumpet's that?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
processElement:	That she would soon be here.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:		       Is your lady come?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
processElement:	Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
processElement:	Out, varlet, from my sight!
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	What means your grace?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
processElement:	Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:	If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
processElement:	Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
processElement:	Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
processElement:
processElement:	[To GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:	Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
processElement:	O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
processElement:	All's not offence that indiscretion finds
processElement:	And dotage terms so.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O sides, you are too tough;
processElement:	Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
processElement:	Deserved much less advancement.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You! did you?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
processElement:	If, till the expiration of your month,
processElement:	You will return and sojourn with my sister,
processElement:	Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
processElement:	I am now from home, and out of that provision
processElement:	Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
processElement:	No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
processElement:	To wage against the enmity o' the air;
processElement:	To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
processElement:	Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
processElement:	Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
processElement:	Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
processElement:	To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
processElement:	To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
processElement:	Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
processElement:	To this detested groom.
processElement:
processElement:	[Pointing at OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	At your choice, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
processElement:	I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
processElement:	We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
processElement:	But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
processElement:	Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
processElement:	Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
processElement:	A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
processElement:	In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
processElement:	Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
processElement:	I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
processElement:	Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
processElement:	Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
processElement:	I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
processElement:	I and my hundred knights.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Not altogether so:
processElement:	I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
processElement:	For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
processElement:	For those that mingle reason with your passion
processElement:	Must be content to think you old, and so--
processElement:	But she knows what she does.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Is this well spoken?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
processElement:	Is it not well? What should you need of more?
processElement:	Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
processElement:	Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
processElement:	Should many people, under two commands,
processElement:	Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
processElement:	From those that she calls servants or from mine?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
processElement:	We could control them. If you will come to me,--
processElement:	For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
processElement:	To bring but five and twenty: to no more
processElement:	Will I give place or notice.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I gave you all--
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	                  And in good time you gave it.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
processElement:	But kept a reservation to be follow'd
processElement:	With such a number. What, must I come to you
processElement:	With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
processElement:	When others are more wicked: not being the worst
processElement:	Stands in some rank of praise.
processElement:
processElement:	[To GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:		         I'll go with thee:
processElement:	Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
processElement:	And thou art twice her love.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Hear me, my lord;
processElement:	What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
processElement:	To follow in a house where twice so many
processElement:	Have a command to tend you?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	What need one?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
processElement:	Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
processElement:	Allow not nature more than nature needs,
processElement:	Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;

processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
processElement:	As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
processElement:	Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
processElement:	With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
processElement:	Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
processElement:	In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
processElement:	Search every acre in the high-grown field,
processElement:	And bring him to our eye.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit an Officer]
processElement:
processElement:		    What can man's wisdom
processElement:	In the restoring his bereaved sense?
processElement:	He that helps him take all my outward worth.
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	There is means, madam:
processElement:	Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
processElement:	The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
processElement:	Are many simples operative, whose power
processElement:	Will close the eye of anguish.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	All blest secrets,
processElement:	All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
processElement:	Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
processElement:	In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
processElement:	Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
processElement:	That wants the means to lead it.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Messenger]
processElement:
processElement:Messenger	News, madam;
processElement:	The British powers are marching hitherward.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	'Tis known before; our preparation stands
processElement:	In expectation of them. O dear father,
processElement:	It is thy business that I go about;
processElement:	Therefore great France
processElement:	My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
processElement:	No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
processElement:	But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
processElement:	Soon may I hear and see him!

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
processElement:	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
processElement:	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
processElement:	Take her, or leave her?
processElement:
processElement:BURGUNDY	Pardon me, royal sir;
processElement:	Election makes not up on such conditions.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
processElement:	I tell you all her wealth.
processElement:
processElement:	[To KING OF FRANCE]
processElement:
processElement:		     For you, great king,
processElement:	I would not from your love make such a stray,
processElement:	To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
processElement:	To avert your liking a more worthier way
processElement:	Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
processElement:	Almost to acknowledge hers.
processElement:
processElement:KING OF FRANCE	This is most strange,
processElement:	That she, that even but now was your best object,
processElement:	The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
processElement:	Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
processElement:	Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
processElement:	So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
processElement:	Must be of such unnatural degree,
processElement:	That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
processElement:	Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
processElement:	Must be a faith that reason without miracle
processElement:	Could never plant in me.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	I yet beseech your majesty,--
processElement:	If for I want that glib and oily art,
processElement:	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
processElement:	I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
processElement:	It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
processElement:	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
processElement:	That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
processElement:	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
processElement:	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
processElement:	As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
processElement:	Hath lost me in your liking.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Better thou
processElement:	Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
processElement:
processElement:KING OF FRANCE	Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
processElement:	Which often leaves the history unspoke
processElement:	That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
processElement:	What say you to the lady? Love's not love
processElement:	When it is mingled with regards that stand
processElement:	Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
processElement:	She is herself a dowry.
processElement:
processElement:BURGUNDY	Royal Lear,
processElement:	Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
processElement:	And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
processElement:	Duchess of Burgundy.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
processElement:
processElement:BURGUNDY	I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
processElement:	That you must lose a husband.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Peace be with Burgundy!
processElement:	Since that respects of fortune are his love,
processElement:	I shall not be his wife.
processElement:
processElement:KING OF FRANCE	Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
processElement:	Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
processElement:	Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
processElement:	Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
processElement:	Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
processElement:	My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
processElement:	Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
processElement:	Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
processElement:	Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
processElement:	Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
processElement:	Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
processElement:	Thou losest here, a better where to find.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
processElement:	Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
processElement:	That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
processElement:	Without our grace, our love, our benison.
processElement:	Come, noble Burgundy.
processElement:
processElement:	[Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,
processElement:	REGAN, and CORDELIA]
processElement:
processElement:KING OF FRANCE	Bid farewell to your sisters.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
processElement:	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
processElement:	And like a sister am most loath to call
processElement:	Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
processElement:	To your professed bosoms I commit him
processElement:	But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
processElement:	I would prefer him to a better place.
processElement:	So, farewell to you both.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Prescribe not us our duties.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Let your study
processElement:	Be to content your lord, who hath received you
processElement:	At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
processElement:	And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
processElement:	Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
processElement:	Well may you prosper!
processElement:
processElement:KING OF FRANCE	Come, my fair Cordelia.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
processElement:	most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
processElement:	father will hence to-night.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	You see how full of changes his age is; the
processElement:	observation we have made of it hath not been
processElement:	little: he always loved our sister most; and
processElement:	with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
processElement:	appears too grossly.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
processElement:	but slenderly known himself.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	The best and soundest of his time hath been but
processElement:	rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
processElement:	not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
processElement:	condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
processElement:	that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
processElement:	him as this of Kent's banishment.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	There is further compliment of leavetaking
processElement:	between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
processElement:	together: if our father carry authority with
processElement:	such dispositions as he bears, this last
processElement:	surrender of his will but offend us.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	We shall further think on't.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	We must do something, and i' the heat.

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE II	The Earl of Gloucester's castle.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDMUND, with a letter]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
processElement:	My services are bound. Wherefore should I
processElement:	Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
processElement:	The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
processElement:	For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
processElement:	Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
processElement:	When my dimensions are as well compact,
processElement:	My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
processElement:	As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
processElement:	With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
processElement:	Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
processElement:	More composition and fierce quality
processElement:	Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
processElement:	Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
processElement:	Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
processElement:	Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
processElement:	Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
processElement:	As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
processElement:	Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
processElement:	And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
processElement:	Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
processElement:	Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
processElement:	And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
processElement:	Confined to exhibition! All this done
processElement:	Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	So please your lordship, none.
processElement:
processElement:	[Putting up the letter]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I know no news, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	What paper were you reading?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Nothing, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
processElement:	it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
processElement:	not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
processElement:	if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
processElement:	from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
processElement:	and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
processElement:	fit for your o'er-looking.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Give me the letter, sir.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
processElement:	contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Let's see, let's see.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
processElement:	this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes
processElement:	the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
processElement:	our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
processElement:	them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
processElement:	in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
processElement:	as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
processElement:	me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
processElement:	would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
processElement:	revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
processElement:	brother,	EDGAR.'
processElement:
processElement:	Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
processElement:	should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
processElement:	Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
processElement:	to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
processElement:	brought it?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
processElement:	cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
processElement:	casement of my closet.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	You know the character to be your brother's?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
processElement:	it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
processElement:	fain think it were not.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	It is his.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
processElement:	not in the contents.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
processElement:	maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
processElement:	and fathers declining, the father should be as
processElement:	ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
processElement:	letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
processElement:	brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
processElement:	seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
processElement:	Where is he?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
processElement:	you to suspend your indignation against my
processElement:	brother till you can derive from him better
processElement:	testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
processElement:	course; where, if you violently proceed against
processElement:	him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
processElement:	gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
processElement:	heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
processElement:	for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
processElement:	affection to your honour, and to no further
processElement:	pretence of danger.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Think you so?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
processElement:	where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
processElement:	auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
processElement:	that without any further delay than this very evening.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He cannot be such a monster--
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Nor is not, sure.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
processElement:	loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
processElement:	out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
processElement:	business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
processElement:	myself, to be in a due resolution.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
processElement:	business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
processElement:	no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
processElement:	reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
processElement:	scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
processElement:	friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
processElement:	cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
processElement:	palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
processElement:	and father. This villain of mine comes under the
processElement:	prediction; there's son against father: the king
processElement:	falls from bias of nature; there's father against
processElement:	child. We have seen the best of our time:
processElement:	machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
processElement:	ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
processElement:	graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
processElement:	lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
processElement:	noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
processElement:	offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
processElement:	when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
processElement:	of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
processElement:	disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
processElement:	if we were villains by necessity; fools by
processElement:	heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
processElement:	treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
processElement:	liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
processElement:	planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
processElement:	by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
processElement:	of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
processElement:	disposition to the charge of a star! My
processElement:	father compounded with my mother under the
processElement:	dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
processElement:	major; so that it follows, I am rough and
processElement:	lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
processElement:	had the maidenliest star in the firmament
processElement:	twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
processElement:	comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
processElement:	sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
processElement:	portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	How now, brother Edmund! what serious
processElement:	contemplation are you in?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
processElement:	this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Do you busy yourself about that?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
processElement:	unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
processElement:	and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
processElement:	ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
processElement:	maledictions against king and nobles; needless
processElement:	diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
processElement:	of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Come, come; when saw you my father last?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Why, the night gone by.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Spake you with him?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Ay, two hours together.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Parted you in good terms? Found you no
processElement:	displeasure in him by word or countenance?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	None at all.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
processElement:	him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
processElement:	till some little time hath qualified the heat of
processElement:	his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
processElement:	in him, that with the mischief of your person it
processElement:	would scarcely allay.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Some villain hath done me wrong.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
processElement:	forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
processElement:	slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
processElement:	lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
processElement:	hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
processElement:	if you do stir abroad, go armed.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Armed, brother!
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
processElement:	am no honest man if there be any good meaning
processElement:	towards you: I have told you what I have seen
processElement:	and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
processElement:	and horror of it: pray you, away.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Shall I hear from you anon?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I do serve you in this business.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	A credulous father! and a brother noble,
processElement:	Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
processElement:	That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
processElement:	My practises ride easy! I see the business.
processElement:	Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
processElement:	All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
processElement:	If only to go warm were gorgeous,
processElement:	Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
processElement:	Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
processElement:	You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
processElement:	You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
processElement:	As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
processElement:	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
processElement:	Against their father, fool me not so much
processElement:	To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
processElement:	And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
processElement:	Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
processElement:	I will have such revenges on you both,
processElement:	That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
processElement:	What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
processElement:	The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
processElement:	No, I'll not weep:
processElement:	I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
processElement:	Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
processElement:	Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm and tempest]
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	This house is little: the old man and his people
processElement:	Cannot be well bestow'd.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
processElement:	And must needs taste his folly.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
processElement:	But not one follower.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	So am I purposed.
processElement:	Where is my lord of Gloucester?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	The king is in high rage.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Whither is he going?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
processElement:	Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
processElement:	There's scarce a bush.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	O, sir, to wilful men,
processElement:	The injuries that they themselves procure
processElement:	Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
processElement:	He is attended with a desperate train;
processElement:	And what they may incense him to, being apt
processElement:	To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
processElement:	My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]

processElement:	KING LEAR
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT III
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE I	A heath.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Who's there, besides foul weather?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I know you. Where's the king?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Contending with the fretful element:
processElement:	Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
processElement:	Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
processElement:	That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
processElement:	Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
processElement:	Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
processElement:	Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
processElement:	The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
processElement:	This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
processElement:	The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
processElement:	Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
processElement:	And bids what will take all.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	But who is with him?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
processElement:	His heart-struck injuries.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Sir, I do know you;
processElement:	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
processElement:	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
processElement:	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
processElement:	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
processElement:	Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
processElement:	Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
processElement:	Which are to France the spies and speculations
processElement:	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
processElement:	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
processElement:	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
processElement:	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
processElement:	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
processElement:	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
processElement:	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
processElement:	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
processElement:SCENE V	Gloucester's castle.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter REGAN and OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	But are my brother's powers set forth?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Ay, madam.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Himself in person there?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Madam, with much ado:
processElement:	Your sister is the better soldier.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	No, madam.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	What might import my sister's letter to him?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I know not, lady.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
processElement:	It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
processElement:	To let him live: where he arrives he moves
processElement:	All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
processElement:	In pity of his misery, to dispatch
processElement:	His nighted life: moreover, to descry
processElement:	The strength o' the enemy.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
processElement:	The ways are dangerous.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I may not, madam:
processElement:	My lady charged my duty in this business.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
processElement:	Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
processElement:	Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
processElement:	Let me unseal the letter.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Madam, I had rather--
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I know your lady does not love her husband;
processElement:	I am sure of that: and at her late being here
processElement:	She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
processElement:	To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I, madam?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
processElement:	Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
processElement:	My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
processElement:	And more convenient is he for my hand
processElement:	Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
processElement:	If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
processElement:	And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
processElement:	I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
processElement:	So, fare you well.
processElement:	If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
processElement:	Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
processElement:	What party I do follow.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Fare thee well.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]

processElement:
processElement:	KING LEAR
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT IV
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE VI	Fields near Dover.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Methinks the ground is even.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Horrible steep.
processElement:	Hark, do you hear the sea?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	No, truly.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
processElement:	By your eyes' anguish.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	So may it be, indeed:
processElement:	Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
processElement:	In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
processElement:	But in my garments.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Methinks you're better spoken.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
processElement:	And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
processElement:	The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
processElement:	Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
processElement:	Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
processElement:	Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
processElement:	The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
processElement:	Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
processElement:	Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
processElement:	Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
processElement:	That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
processElement:	Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
processElement:	Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
processElement:	Topple down headlong.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Set me where you stand.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
processElement:	Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
processElement:	Would I not leap upright.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Let go my hand.
processElement:	Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
processElement:	Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
processElement:	Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
processElement:	Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Now fare you well, good sir.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	With all my heart.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Why I do trifle thus with his despair
processElement:	Is done to cure it.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
processElement:	This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
processElement:	Shake patiently my great affliction off:
processElement:	If I could bear it longer, and not fall
processElement:	To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
processElement:	My snuff and loathed part of nature should
processElement:	Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
processElement:	Now, fellow, fare thee well.
processElement:
processElement:	[He falls forward]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Gone, sir: farewell.
processElement:	And yet I know not how conceit may rob
processElement:	The treasury of life, when life itself
processElement:	Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
processElement:	By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
processElement:	Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
processElement:	Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
processElement:	What are you, sir?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	                  Away, and let me die.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
processElement:	So many fathom down precipitating,
processElement:	Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
processElement:	Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
processElement:	Ten masts at each make not the altitude
processElement:	Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
processElement:	Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	But have I fall'n, or no?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
processElement:	Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
processElement:	Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Alack, I have no eyes.
processElement:	Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
processElement:	To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
processElement:	When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
processElement:	And frustrate his proud will.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Give me your arm:
processElement:	Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Too well, too well.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	This is above all strangeness.
processElement:	Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
processElement:	Which parted from you?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	A poor unfortunate beggar.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	As I stood here below, methought his eyes
processElement:	Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
processElement:	Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
processElement:	It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
processElement:	Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
processElement:	Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
processElement:	Affliction till it do cry out itself
processElement:	'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
processElement:	I took it for a man; often 'twould say
processElement:	'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers]
processElement:
processElement:	The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
processElement:	His master thus.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
processElement:	king himself.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	O thou side-piercing sight!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
processElement:	press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
processElement:	crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
processElement:	look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
processElement:	cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
processElement:	it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
processElement:	flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
processElement:	Give the word.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Sweet marjoram.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Pass.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I know that voice.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
processElement:	me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
processElement:	beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
processElement:	and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
processElement:	too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
processElement:	wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
processElement:	the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
processElement:	found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
processElement:	not men o' their words: they told me I was every
processElement:	thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	The trick of that voice I do well remember:
processElement:	Is 't not the king?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ay, every inch a king:
processElement:	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
processElement:	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
processElement:	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
processElement:	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
processElement:	Does lecher in my sight.
processElement:	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
processElement:	Was kinder to his father than my daughters
processElement:	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
processElement:	To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
processElement:	Behold yond simpering dame,
processElement:	Whose face between her forks presages snow;
processElement:	That minces virtue, and does shake the head
processElement:	To hear of pleasure's name;
processElement:	The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
processElement:	With a more riotous appetite.
processElement:	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
processElement:	Though women all above:
processElement:	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
processElement:	Beneath is all the fiends';
processElement:	There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
processElement:	sulphurous pit,
processElement:	Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
processElement:	fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
processElement:	good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
processElement:	there's money for thee.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O, let me kiss that hand!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
processElement:	Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
processElement:	at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
processElement:	love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
processElement:	penning of it.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I would not take this from report; it is,
processElement:	And my heart breaks at it.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Read.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	What, with the case of eyes?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
processElement:	head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
processElement:	a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
processElement:	this world goes.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I see it feelingly.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
processElement:	with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
processElement:	justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
processElement:	thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
processElement:	is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
processElement:	a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Ay, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	And the creature run from the cur? There thou
processElement:	mightst behold the great image of authority: a
processElement:	dog's obeyed in office.
processElement:	Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
processElement:	Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
processElement:	Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
processElement:	For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
processElement:	Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
processElement:	Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
processElement:	And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
processElement:	Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
processElement:	None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
processElement:	Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
processElement:	To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
processElement:	And like a scurvy politician, seem
processElement:	To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
processElement:	Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
processElement:	I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
processElement:	Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
processElement:	Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
processElement:	We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack the day!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	When we are born, we cry that we are come
processElement:	To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
processElement:	It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
processElement:	A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
processElement:	And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
processElement:	Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants]
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
processElement:	Your most dear daughter--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
processElement:	The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
processElement:	You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
processElement:	I am cut to the brains.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	You shall have any thing.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No seconds? all myself?
processElement:	Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
processElement:	To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
processElement:	Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Good sir,--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
processElement:	I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
processElement:	My masters, know you that.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	You are a royal one, and we obey you.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
processElement:	shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit running; Attendants follow]
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
processElement:	Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
processElement:	Who redeems nature from the general curse
processElement:	Which twain have brought her to.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Hail, gentle sir.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
processElement:	Which can distinguish sound.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	But, by your favour,
processElement:	How near's the other army?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
processElement:	Stands on the hourly thought.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I thank you, sir: that's all.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Though that the queen on special cause is here,
processElement:	Her army is moved on.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I thank you, sir.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
processElement:	Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
processElement:	To die before you please!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Well pray you, father.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Now, good sir, what are you?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
processElement:	Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
processElement:	Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
processElement:	I'll lead you to some biding.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Hearty thanks:
processElement:	The bounty and the benison of heaven
processElement:	To boot, and boot!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
processElement:	That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
processElement:	To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
processElement:	Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
processElement:	That must destroy thee.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Now let thy friendly hand
processElement:	Put strength enough to't.
processElement:
processElement:	[EDGAR interposes]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Wherefore, bold peasant,
processElement:	Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
processElement:	Lest that the infection of his fortune take
processElement:	Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Let go, slave, or thou diest!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
processElement:	pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
processElement:	'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
processElement:	Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
processElement:	ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
processElement:	the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Out, dunghill!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
processElement:	your foins.
processElement:
processElement:	[They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
processElement:	If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
processElement:	And give the letters which thou find'st about me
processElement:	To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
processElement:	Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
processElement:
processElement:	[Dies]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
processElement:	As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
processElement:	As badness would desire.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	What, is he dead?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Sit you down, father; rest you
processElement:	Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
processElement:	May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
processElement:	He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
processElement:	Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
processElement:	To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
processElement:	Their papers, is more lawful.
processElement:
processElement:	[Reads]
processElement:
processElement:	'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
processElement:	In some of our best ports, and are at point
processElement:	To show their open banner. Now to you:
processElement:	If on my credit you dare build so far
processElement:	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
processElement:	Some that will thank you, making just report
processElement:	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
processElement:	The king hath cause to plain.
processElement:	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
processElement:	And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
processElement:	This office to you.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	I will talk further with you.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No, do not.
processElement:	For confirmation that I am much more
processElement:	Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
processElement:	What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
processElement:	As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
processElement:	And she will tell you who your fellow is
processElement:	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
processElement:	I will go seek the king.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
processElement:	That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
processElement:	That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
processElement:	Holla the other.

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT III
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE II	Another part of the heath. Storm still.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KING LEAR and Fool]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
processElement:	You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
processElement:	Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
processElement:	You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
processElement:	Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
processElement:	Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
processElement:	Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
processElement:	Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
processElement:	That make ingrateful man!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
processElement:	house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
processElement:	Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
processElement:	here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
processElement:	Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
processElement:	I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
processElement:	I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
processElement:	You owe me no subscription: then let fall
processElement:	Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
processElement:	A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
processElement:	But yet I call you servile ministers,
processElement:	That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
processElement:	Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
processElement:	So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	He that has a house to put's head in has a good
processElement:	head-piece.
processElement:	The cod-piece that will house
processElement:	Before the head has any,
processElement:	The head and he shall louse;
processElement:	So beggars marry many.
processElement:	The man that makes his toe
processElement:	What he his heart should make
processElement:	Shall of a corn cry woe,
processElement:	And turn his sleep to wake.
processElement:	For there was never yet fair woman but she made
processElement:	mouths in a glass.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
processElement:	I will say nothing.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Who's there?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
processElement:	man and a fool.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
processElement:	Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
processElement:	Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
processElement:	And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
processElement:	Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
processElement:	Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
processElement:	Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
processElement:	The affliction nor the fear.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let the great gods,
processElement:	That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
processElement:	Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
processElement:	That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
processElement:	Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
processElement:	Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
processElement:	That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
processElement:	That under covert and convenient seeming
processElement:	Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
processElement:	Rive your concealing continents, and cry
processElement:	These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
processElement:	More sinn'd against than sinning.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Alack, bare-headed!
processElement:	Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
processElement:	Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
processElement:	Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
processElement:	More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
processElement:	Which even but now, demanding after you,
processElement:	Denied me to come in--return, and force
processElement:	Their scanted courtesy.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	My wits begin to turn.
processElement:	Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
processElement:	I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
processElement:	The art of our necessities is strange,
processElement:	That can make vile things precious. Come,
processElement:	your hovel.
processElement:	Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
processElement:	That's sorry yet for thee.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	[Singing]
processElement:
processElement:	He that has and a little tiny wit--
processElement:	With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
processElement:	Must make content with his fortunes fit,
processElement:	For the rain it raineth every day.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT]
processElement:
processElement:Fool	This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
processElement:	I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
processElement:	When priests are more in word than matter;
processElement:	When brewers mar their malt with water;
processElement:	When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
processElement:	No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
processElement:	When every case in law is right;
processElement:	No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
processElement:	When slanders do not live in tongues;
processElement:	Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
processElement:	When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
processElement:	And bawds and whores do churches build;
processElement:	Then shall the realm of Albion
processElement:	Come to great confusion:
processElement:	Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
processElement:	That going shall be used with feet.
processElement:	This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

processElement:ACT III
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE III	Gloucester's castle.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
processElement:	dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
processElement:	pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
processElement:	house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
processElement:	displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
processElement:	him, nor any way sustain him.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Most savage and unnatural!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
processElement:	the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
processElement:	received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
processElement:	spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
processElement:	these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
processElement:	home; there's part of a power already footed: we
processElement:	must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
processElement:	privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
processElement:	the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
processElement:	if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
processElement:	Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
processElement:	the king my old master must be relieved. There is
processElement:	some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
processElement:	Instantly know; and of that letter too:
processElement:	This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
processElement:	That which my father loses; no less than all:
processElement:	The younger rises when the old doth fall.

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE IV	The heath. Before a hovel.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
processElement:	The tyranny of the open night's too rough
processElement:	For nature to endure.
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm still]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let me alone.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Good my lord, enter here.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Wilt break my heart?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
processElement:	Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
processElement:	But where the greater malady is fix'd,
processElement:	The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
processElement:	But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
processElement:	Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
processElement:	mind's free,
processElement:	The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
processElement:	Doth from my senses take all feeling else
processElement:	Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
processElement:	Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
processElement:	For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
processElement:	No, I will weep no more. In such a night
processElement:	To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
processElement:	In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
processElement:	Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
processElement:	O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
processElement:	No more of that.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  Good my lord, enter here.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
processElement:	This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
processElement:	On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
processElement:	Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
processElement:
processElement:	[Fool goes in]
processElement:
processElement:	Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
processElement:	That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
processElement:	How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
processElement:	Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
processElement:	From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
processElement:	Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
processElement:	Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
processElement:	That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
processElement:	And show the heavens more just.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
processElement:
processElement:	[The Fool runs out from the hovel]
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
processElement:	Help me, help me!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Give me thy hand. Who's there?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
processElement:	Come forth.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Away! the foul fiend follows me!
processElement:	Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
processElement:	Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
processElement:	And art thou come to this?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
processElement:	fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
processElement:	through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
processElement:	that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
processElement:	in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
processElement:	proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
processElement:	four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
processElement:	traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
processElement:	de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
processElement:	star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
processElement:	charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
processElement:	have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm still]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
processElement:	Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
processElement:	Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	He hath no daughters, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
processElement:	To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
processElement:	Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
processElement:	Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
processElement:	Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
processElement:	Those pelican daughters.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
processElement:	Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
processElement:	keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
processElement:	man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
processElement:	array. Tom's a-cold.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What hast thou been?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
processElement:	my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Yes, madam.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
processElement:	He flashes into one gross crime or other,
processElement:	That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
processElement:	His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
processElement:	On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
processElement:	I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
processElement:	If you come slack of former services,
processElement:	You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	He's coming, madam; I hear him.
processElement:
processElement:	[Horns within]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Put on what weary negligence you please,
processElement:	You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
processElement:	If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
processElement:	Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
processElement:	Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
processElement:	That still would manage those authorities
processElement:	That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
processElement:	Old fools are babes again; and must be used
processElement:	With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
processElement:	Remember what I tell you.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Well, madam.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	And let his knights have colder looks among you;
processElement:	What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
processElement:	I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
processElement:	That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
processElement:	To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

processElement:SCENE IV	A hall in the same.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT, disguised]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	If but as well I other accents borrow,
processElement:	That can my speech defuse, my good intent
processElement:	May carry through itself to that full issue
processElement:	For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
processElement:	If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
processElement:	So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
processElement:	Shall find thee full of labours.
processElement:
processElement:	[Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and
processElement:	Attendants]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit an Attendant]
processElement:
processElement:	How now! what art thou?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	A man, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
processElement:	many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
processElement:	want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
processElement:	There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
processElement:	then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
processElement:	him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
processElement:	that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
processElement:	and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
processElement:	cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What art thou?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
processElement:	king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Service.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Who wouldst thou serve?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	You.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Dost thou know me, fellow?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
processElement:	which I would fain call master.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What's that?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Authority.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What services canst thou do?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
processElement:	tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
processElement:	bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
processElement:	qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	How old art thou?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
processElement:	so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
processElement:	on my back forty eight.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
processElement:	worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
processElement:	Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
processElement:	Go you, and call my fool hither.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit an Attendant]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:	You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	So please you,--
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit a Knight]
processElement:
processElement:	Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter Knight]
processElement:
processElement:	How now! where's that mongrel?
processElement:
processElement:Knight	He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
processElement:
processElement:Knight	Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
processElement:	not.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	He would not!
processElement:
processElement:Knight	My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
processElement:	judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
processElement:	ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
processElement:	great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
processElement:	general dependants as in the duke himself also and
processElement:	your daughter.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ha! sayest thou so?
processElement:
processElement:Knight	I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
processElement:	for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
processElement:	highness wronged.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
processElement:	have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
processElement:	have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
processElement:	than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
processElement:	I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
processElement:	have not seen him this two days.
processElement:
processElement:Knight	Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
processElement:	fool hath much pined away.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
processElement:	tell my daughter I would speak with her.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit an Attendant]
processElement:
processElement:	Go you, call hither my fool.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit an Attendant]
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:	O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
processElement:	sir?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	My lady's father.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
processElement:	whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
processElement:
processElement:	[Striking him]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I'll not be struck, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
processElement:
processElement:	[Tripping up his heels]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
processElement:	love thee.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
processElement:	away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
processElement:	length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
processElement:	wisdom? so.
processElement:
processElement:	[Pushes OSWALD out]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
processElement:	earnest of thy service.
processElement:
processElement:	[Giving KENT money]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter Fool]
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
processElement:
processElement:	[Offering KENT his cap]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Why, fool?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
processElement:	nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
processElement:	thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
processElement:	why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
processElement:	and did the third a blessing against his will; if
processElement:	thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
processElement:	How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why, my boy?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
processElement:	myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Take heed, sirrah; the whip.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
processElement:	out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	A pestilent gall to me!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Do.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Mark it, nuncle:
processElement:	Have more than thou showest,
processElement:	Speak less than thou knowest,
processElement:	Lend less than thou owest,
processElement:	Ride more than thou goest,
processElement:	Learn more than thou trowest,
processElement:	Set less than thou throwest;
processElement:	Leave thy drink and thy whore,
processElement:	And keep in-a-door,
processElement:	And thou shalt have more
processElement:	Than two tens to a score.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	This is nothing, fool.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
processElement:	gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
processElement:	nothing, nuncle?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
processElement:	his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	A bitter fool!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
processElement:	bitter fool and a sweet fool?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, lad; teach me.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	That lord that counsell'd thee
processElement:	To give away thy land,
processElement:	Come place him here by me,
processElement:	Do thou for him stand:
processElement:	The sweet and bitter fool
processElement:	Will presently appear;
processElement:	The one in motley here,
processElement:	The other found out there.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Dost thou call me fool, boy?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
processElement:	thou wast born with.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	This is not altogether fool, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
processElement:	I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
processElement:	and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
processElement:	to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
processElement:	nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What two crowns shall they be?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
processElement:	up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
processElement:	clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
processElement:	both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
processElement:	the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
processElement:	when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
processElement:	like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
processElement:	finds it so.
processElement:
processElement:	[Singing]
processElement:
processElement:	Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
processElement:	For wise men are grown foppish,
processElement:	They know not how their wits to wear,
processElement:	Their manners are so apish.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
processElement:	daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
processElement:	the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
processElement:
processElement:	[Singing]
processElement:
processElement:	Then they for sudden joy did weep,
processElement:	And I for sorrow sung,
processElement:	That such a king should play bo-peep,
processElement:	And go the fools among.
processElement:
processElement:	Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
processElement:	thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
processElement:	the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
processElement:	the place for your labour.
processElement:		'Your--wife, so I would say--
processElement:		'Affectionate servant,
processElement:		'GONERIL.'
processElement:	O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
processElement:	A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
processElement:	And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
processElement:	Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
processElement:	Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
processElement:	With this ungracious paper strike the sight
processElement:	Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
processElement:	That of thy death and business I can tell.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
processElement:	That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
processElement:	Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
processElement:	So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
processElement:	And woes by wrong imaginations lose
processElement:	The knowledge of themselves.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Give me your hand:
processElement:
processElement:	[Drum afar off]
processElement:
processElement:	Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
processElement:	Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

processElement:ACT IV
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE VII	A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,
processElement:	soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor]
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
processElement:	To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
processElement:	And every measure fail me.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
processElement:	All my reports go with the modest truth;
processElement:	Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Be better suited:
processElement:	These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
processElement:	I prithee, put them off.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Pardon me, dear madam;
processElement:	Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
processElement:	My boon I make it, that you know me not
processElement:	Till time and I think meet.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Then be't so, my good lord.
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Doctor]
processElement:
processElement:		      How does the king?
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	Madam, sleeps still.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	O you kind gods,
processElement:	Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
processElement:	The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
processElement:	Of this child-changed father!
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	So please your majesty
processElement:	That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
processElement:	I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
processElement:	We put fresh garments on him.
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
processElement:	I doubt not of his temperance.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Very well.
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	O my dear father! Restoration hang
processElement:	Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
processElement:	Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
processElement:	Have in thy reverence made!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Kind and dear princess!
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Had you not been their father, these white flakes
processElement:	Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
processElement:	To be opposed against the warring winds?
processElement:	To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
processElement:	In the most terrible and nimble stroke
processElement:	Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
processElement:	With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
processElement:	Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
processElement:	Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
processElement:	To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
processElement:	In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
processElement:	'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
processElement:	Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
processElement:	Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
processElement:	Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
processElement:	Do scald like moulten lead.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Sir, do you know me?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Still, still, far wide!
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
processElement:	I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
processElement:	To see another thus. I know not what to say.
processElement:	my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
processElement:	her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
processElement:	broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
processElement:	slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
processElement:	wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
processElement:	out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
processElement:	ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
processElement:	wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
processElement:	Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
processElement:	silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
processElement:	out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
processElement:	from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
processElement:	Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
processElement:	Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
processElement:	Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm still]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
processElement:	I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
processElement:	I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
processElement:	Of my condition!
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	                  O, look upon me, sir,
processElement:	And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
processElement:	No, sir, you must not kneel.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Pray, do not mock me:
processElement:	I am a very foolish fond old man,
processElement:	Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
processElement:	And, to deal plainly,
processElement:	I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
processElement:	Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
processElement:	Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
processElement:	What place this is; and all the skill I have
processElement:	Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
processElement:	Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
processElement:	For, as I am a man, I think this lady
processElement:	To be my child Cordelia.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	And so I am, I am.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
processElement:	If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
processElement:	I know you do not love me; for your sisters
processElement:	Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
processElement:	You have some cause, they have not.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	No cause, no cause.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Am I in France?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  In your own kingdom, sir.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Do not abuse me.
processElement:
processElement:Doctor	Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
processElement:	You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
processElement:	To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
processElement:	Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
processElement:	Till further settling.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	Will't please your highness walk?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You must bear with me:
processElement:	Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Most certain, sir.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Who is conductor of his people?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
processElement:	of Kent in Germany.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
processElement:	powers of the kingdom approach apace.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
processElement:	well, sir.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	My point and period will be throughly wrought,
processElement:	Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN,
processElement:	Gentlemen, and Soldiers.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
processElement:	Or whether since he is advised by aught
processElement:	To change the course: he's full of alteration
processElement:	And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
processElement:
processElement:	[To a Gentleman, who goes out]
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	'Tis to be doubted, madam.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Now, sweet lord,
processElement:	You know the goodness I intend upon you:
processElement:	Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
processElement:	Do you not love my sister?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	In honour'd love.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	But have you never found my brother's way
processElement:	To the forfended place?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	That thought abuses you.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
processElement:	And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	No, by mine honour, madam.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
processElement:	Be not familiar with her.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Fear me not:
processElement:	She and the duke her husband!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister
processElement:	Should loosen him and me.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Our very loving sister, well be-met.
processElement:	Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
processElement:	With others whom the rigor of our state
processElement:	Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
processElement:	I never yet was valiant: for this business,
processElement:	It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
processElement:	Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
processElement:	Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Sir, you speak nobly.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Why is this reason'd?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
processElement:	For these domestic and particular broils
processElement:	Are not the question here.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Let's then determine
processElement:	With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I shall attend you presently at your tent.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Sister, you'll go with us?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	No.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
processElement:
processElement:	[As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
processElement:	Hear me one word.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	                  I'll overtake you. Speak.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
processElement:	If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
processElement:	For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
processElement:	I can produce a champion that will prove
processElement:	What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
processElement:	Your business of the world hath so an end,
processElement:	And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Stay till I have read the letter.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	I was forbid it.
processElement:	When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
processElement:	And I'll appear again.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
processElement:	Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
processElement:	By diligent discovery; but your haste
processElement:	Is now urged on you.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	We will greet the time.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
processElement:	Each jealous of the other, as the stung
processElement:	Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
processElement:	Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
processElement:	If both remain alive: to take the widow
processElement:	Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
processElement:	And hardly shall I carry out my side,
processElement:	Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
processElement:	His countenance for the battle; which being done,
processElement:	Let her who would be rid of him devise
processElement:	His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
processElement:	Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
processElement:	The battle done, and they within our power,
processElement:	Shall never see his pardon; for my state
processElement:	Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

processElement:	Give me thy hand; come on.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure

processElement:	That are to censure them.
processElement:
processElement:CORDELIA	We are not the first
processElement:	Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
processElement:	For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
processElement:	Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
processElement:	Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
processElement:	We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
processElement:	When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
processElement:	And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
processElement:	And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
processElement:	At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
processElement:	Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
processElement:	Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
processElement:	And take upon's the mystery of things,
processElement:	As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
processElement:	In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
processElement:	That ebb and flow by the moon.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Take them away.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
processElement:	The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
processElement:	He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
processElement:	And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
processElement:	The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
processElement:	Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve

processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Come hither, captain; hark.
processElement:	Take thou this note;
processElement:
processElement:	[Giving a paper]
processElement:
processElement:		go follow them to prison:
processElement:	One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
processElement:	As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
processElement:	To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
processElement:	Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
processElement:	Does not become a sword: thy great employment
processElement:	Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
processElement:	Or thrive by other means.
processElement:
processElement:Captain	I'll do 't, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
processElement:	Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
processElement:	As I have set it down.
processElement:
processElement:Captain	I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
processElement:	If it be man's work, I'll do 't.

processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
processElement:	And fortune led you well: you have the captives
processElement:	That were the opposites of this day's strife:
processElement:	We do require them of you, so to use them
processElement:	As we shall find their merits and our safety
processElement:	May equally determine.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Sir, I thought it fit
processElement:	To send the old and miserable king
processElement:	To some retention and appointed guard;
processElement:	Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
processElement:	To pluck the common bosom on his side,
processElement:	An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
processElement:	Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
processElement:	My reason all the same; and they are ready
processElement:	To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
processElement:	Where you shall hold your session. At this time
processElement:	We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
processElement:	And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
processElement:	By those that feel their sharpness:
processElement:	The question of Cordelia and her father
processElement:	Requires a fitter place.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Sir, by your patience,
processElement:	I hold you but a subject of this war,
processElement:	Not as a brother.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	                  That's as we list to grace him.
processElement:	Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
processElement:	Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
processElement:	Bore the commission of my place and person;
processElement:	The which immediacy may well stand up,
processElement:	And call itself your brother.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Not so hot:
processElement:	In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
processElement:	More than in your addition.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	In my rights,
processElement:	By me invested, he compeers the best.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	That were the most, if he should husband you.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Jesters do oft prove prophets.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Holla, holla!
processElement:	That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
processElement:	From a full-flowing stomach. General,
processElement:	Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
processElement:	Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
processElement:	Witness the world, that I create thee here
processElement:	My lord and master.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Mean you to enjoy him?
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	The let-alone lies not in your good will.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Nor in thine, lord.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Half-blooded fellow, yes.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
processElement:	On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
processElement:	This gilded serpent
processElement:
processElement:	[Pointing to Goneril]
processElement:
processElement:	For your claim, fair sister,
processElement:	I bar it in the interest of my wife:
processElement:	'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
processElement:	And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
processElement:	If you will marry, make your loves to me,
processElement:	My lady is bespoke.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	An interlude!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
processElement:	If none appear to prove upon thy head
processElement:	Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
processElement:	There is my pledge;
processElement:
processElement:	[Throwing down a glove]
processElement:
processElement:	I'll prove it on thy heart,
processElement:	Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
processElement:	Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Sick, O, sick!
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	There's my exchange:
processElement:
processElement:	[Throwing down a glove]
processElement:
processElement:		what in the world he is
processElement:	That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
processElement:	Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
processElement:	On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
processElement:	My truth and honour firmly.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	A herald, ho!
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	                  A herald, ho, a herald!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
processElement:	All levied in my name, have in my name
processElement:	Took their discharge.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	My sickness grows upon me.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	She is not well; convey her to my tent.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit Regan, led]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Herald]
processElement:
processElement:	Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
processElement:	And read out this.
processElement:
processElement:Captain	Sound, trumpet!
processElement:
processElement:	[A trumpet sounds]
processElement:
processElement:Herald	[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within
processElement:	the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
processElement:	supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
processElement:	traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
processElement:	trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Sound!
processElement:
processElement:	[First trumpet]
processElement:
processElement:Herald	Again!
processElement:
processElement:	[Second trumpet]
processElement:
processElement:Herald	Again!
processElement:
processElement:	[Third trumpet]
processElement:
processElement:	[Trumpet answers within]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a
processElement:	trumpet before him]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Ask him his purposes, why he appears
processElement:	Upon this call o' the trumpet.
processElement:
processElement:Herald	What are you?
processElement:	Your name, your quality? and why you answer
processElement:	This present summons?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Know, my name is lost;
processElement:	By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
processElement:	Yet am I noble as the adversary
processElement:	I come to cope.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	                  Which is that adversary?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Himself: what say'st thou to him?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Draw thy sword,
processElement:	That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
processElement:	Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
processElement:	Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
processElement:	My oath, and my profession: I protest,
processElement:	Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
processElement:	Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
processElement:	Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
processElement:	False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
processElement:	Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
processElement:	And, from the extremest upward of thy head
processElement:	To the descent and dust below thy foot,
processElement:	A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
processElement:	This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
processElement:	To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
processElement:	Thou liest.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	In wisdom I should ask thy name;
processElement:	But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
processElement:	And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
processElement:	What safe and nicely I might well delay
processElement:	By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
processElement:	Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
processElement:	With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
processElement:	Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
processElement:	This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
processElement:	Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
processElement:
processElement:	[Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Save him, save him!
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	This is practise, Gloucester:
processElement:	By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
processElement:	An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
processElement:	But cozen'd and beguiled.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Shut your mouth, dame,
processElement:	Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
processElement:	Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
processElement:	No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
processElement:
processElement:	[Gives the letter to EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
processElement:	Who can arraign me for't.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Most monstrous! oh!
processElement:	Know'st thou this paper?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Ask me not what I know.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	What you have charged me with, that have I done;
processElement:	And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
processElement:	'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
processElement:	That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
processElement:	I do forgive thee.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	                  Let's exchange charity.
processElement:	I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
processElement:	If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
processElement:	My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
processElement:	The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
processElement:	Make instruments to plague us:
processElement:	The dark and vicious place where thee he got
processElement:	Cost him his eyes.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
processElement:	The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Methought thy very gait did prophesy
processElement:	A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
processElement:	Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
processElement:	Did hate thee or thy father!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Worthy prince, I know't.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Where have you hid yourself?
processElement:	How have you known the miseries of your father?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
processElement:	And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
processElement:	The bloody proclamation to escape,
processElement:	That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
processElement:	That we the pain of death would hourly die
processElement:	Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
processElement:	Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
processElement:	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
processElement:	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
processElement:	Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
processElement:	Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
processElement:	Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
processElement:	Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
processElement:	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
processElement:	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
processElement:	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
processElement:	Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
processElement:	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
processElement:	Burst smilingly.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	This speech of yours hath moved me,
processElement:	And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
processElement:	You look as you had something more to say.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
processElement:	For I am almost ready to dissolve,
processElement:	Hearing of this.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	                  This would have seem'd a period
processElement:	To such as love not sorrow; but another,
processElement:	To amplify too much, would make much more,
processElement:	And top extremity.
processElement:	Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
processElement:	Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
processElement:	Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
processElement:	Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
processElement:	He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
processElement:	As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
processElement:	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
processElement:	That ever ear received: which in recounting
processElement:	His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
processElement:	Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
processElement:	And there I left him tranced.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	But who was this?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
processElement:	Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
processElement:	Improper for a slave.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife]
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Help, help, O, help!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	What kind of help?
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Speak, man.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	What means that bloody knife?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	'Tis hot, it smokes;
processElement:	It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Who dead? speak, man.
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
processElement:	By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I was contracted to them both: all three
processElement:	Now marry in an instant.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Here comes Kent.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
processElement:	This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
processElement:	Touches us not with pity.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT]
processElement:
processElement:		    O, is this he?
processElement:	The time will not allow the compliment
processElement:	Which very manners urges.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I am come
processElement:	To bid my king and master aye good night:
processElement:	Is he not here?
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	                  Great thing of us forgot!
processElement:	Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
processElement:	See'st thou this object, Kent?
processElement:
processElement:	[The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in]
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Alack, why thus?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	                  Yet Edmund was beloved:
processElement:	The one the other poison'd for my sake,
processElement:	And after slew herself.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Even so. Cover their faces.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
processElement:	Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
processElement:	Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
processElement:	Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
processElement:	Nay, send in time.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	                  Run, run, O, run!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
processElement:	Thy token of reprieve.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Well thought on: take my sword,
processElement:	Give it the captain.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Haste thee, for thy life.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	He hath commission from thy wife and me
processElement:	To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
processElement:	To lay the blame upon her own despair,
processElement:	That she fordid herself.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
processElement:
processElement:	[EDMUND is borne off]
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;
processElement:	EDGAR, Captain, and others following]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
processElement:	Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
processElement:	That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
processElement:	I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
processElement:	She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
processElement:	If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
processElement:	Why, then she lives.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Is this the promised end
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Or image of that horror?
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Fall, and cease!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
processElement:	It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
processElement:	That ever I have felt.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	[Kneeling]  O my good master!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Prithee, away.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
processElement:	I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
processElement:	Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
processElement:	What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
processElement:	Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
processElement:	I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
processElement:
processElement:Captain	'Tis true, my lords, he did.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Did I not, fellow?
processElement:	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
processElement:	I would have made them skip: I am old now,
processElement:	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
processElement:	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
processElement:	One of them we behold.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	The same,
processElement:	Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
processElement:	He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I'll see that straight.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	That, from your first of difference and decay,
processElement:	Have follow'd your sad steps.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	You are welcome hither.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
processElement:	Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
processElement:	And desperately are dead.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ay, so I think.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	He knows not what he says: and vain it is
processElement:	That we present us to him.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Very bootless.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter a Captain]
processElement:
processElement:Captain	Edmund is dead, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	That's but a trifle here.
processElement:	You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
processElement:	What comfort to this great decay may come
processElement:	Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
processElement:	During the life of this old majesty,
processElement:	To him our absolute power:
processElement:
processElement:	[To EDGAR and KENT]
processElement:
processElement:		     you, to your rights:
processElement:	With boot, and such addition as your honours
processElement:	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
processElement:	The wages of their virtue, and all foes
processElement:	The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
processElement:	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
processElement:	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
processElement:	Never, never, never, never, never!
processElement:	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
processElement:	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
processElement:	Look there, look there!
processElement:
processElement:	[Dies]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	He faints! My lord, my lord!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Break, heart; I prithee, break!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Look up, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
processElement:	That would upon the rack of this tough world
processElement:	Stretch him out longer.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	He is gone, indeed.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
processElement:	He but usurp'd his life.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Bear them from hence. Our present business
processElement:	Is general woe.
processElement:
processElement:	[To KENT and EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	Friends of my soul, you twain
processElement:	Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
processElement:	My master calls me, I must not say no.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	The weight of this sad time we must obey;
processElement:	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
processElement:	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
processElement:	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt, with a dead march]
processElement:
processElement:Fool	I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
processElement:	they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
processElement:	have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
processElement:	whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
processElement:	kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
processElement:	thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
processElement:	and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
processElement:	the parings.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
processElement:	Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
processElement:	care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
processElement:	figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
processElement:	thou art nothing.
processElement:
processElement:	[To GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:	Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
processElement:	bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
processElement:	He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
processElement:	Weary of all, shall want some.
processElement:
processElement:	[Pointing to KING LEAR]
processElement:
processElement:	That's a shealed peascod.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
processElement:	But other of your insolent retinue
processElement:	Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
processElement:	In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
processElement:	I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
processElement:	To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
processElement:	By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
processElement:	That you protect this course, and put it on
processElement:	By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
processElement:	Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
processElement:	Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
processElement:	Might in their working do you that offence,
processElement:	Which else were shame, that then necessity
processElement:	Will call discreet proceeding.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	For, you trow, nuncle,
processElement:	The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
processElement:	That it's had it head bit off by it young.
processElement:	So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Are you our daughter?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Come, sir,
processElement:	I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
processElement:	Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
processElement:	These dispositions, that of late transform you
processElement:	From what you rightly are.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	May not an ass know when the cart
processElement:	draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
processElement:	Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
processElement:	Either his notion weakens, his discernings
processElement:	Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
processElement:	Who is it that can tell me who I am?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Lear's shadow.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I would learn that; for, by the
processElement:	marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
processElement:	I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Which they will make an obedient father.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Your name, fair gentlewoman?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
processElement:	Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
processElement:	To understand my purposes aright:
processElement:	As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
processElement:	Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
processElement:	Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
processElement:	That this our court, infected with their manners,
processElement:	Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
processElement:	Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
processElement:	Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
processElement:	For instant remedy: be then desired
processElement:	By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
processElement:	A little to disquantity your train;
processElement:	And the remainder, that shall still depend,
processElement:	To be such men as may besort your age,
processElement:	And know themselves and you.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Darkness and devils!
processElement:	Saddle my horses; call my train together:
processElement:	Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
processElement:	Yet have I left a daughter.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
processElement:	Make servants of their betters.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter ALBANY]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Woe, that too late repents,--
processElement:
processElement:	[To ALBANY]
processElement:
processElement:		        O, sir, are you come?
processElement:	Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
processElement:	with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
processElement:	Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
processElement:	owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
processElement:	no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
processElement:	's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
processElement:	unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
processElement:	forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
processElement:	come unbutton here.
processElement:
processElement:	[Tearing off his clothes]
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
processElement:	to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
processElement:	like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
processElement:	rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
processElement:	at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
processElement:	the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
processElement:	hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
processElement:	poor creature of earth.
processElement:	S. Withold footed thrice the old;
processElement:	He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
processElement:	Bid her alight,
processElement:	And her troth plight,
processElement:	And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	How fares your grace?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What's he?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Who's there? What is't you seek?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	What are you there? Your names?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
processElement:	Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
processElement:	More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
processElement:	Than the sea-monster!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Pray, sir, be patient.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.
processElement:	My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
processElement:	That all particulars of duty know,
processElement:	And in the most exact regard support
processElement:	The worships of their name. O most small fault,
processElement:	How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
processElement:	That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
processElement:	From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
processElement:	And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
processElement:	Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
processElement:
processElement:	[Striking his head]
processElement:
processElement:	And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
processElement:	Of what hath moved you.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	It may be so, my lord.
processElement:	Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
processElement:	Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
processElement:	To make this creature fruitful!
processElement:	Into her womb convey sterility!
processElement:	Dry up in her the organs of increase;
processElement:	And from her derogate body never spring
processElement:	A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
processElement:	Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
processElement:	And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
processElement:	Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
processElement:	With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
processElement:	Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
processElement:	To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
processElement:	How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
processElement:	To have a thankless child! Away, away!
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
processElement:	But let his disposition have that scope
processElement:	That dotage gives it.
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter KING LEAR]
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
processElement:	Within a fortnight!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	What's the matter, sir?
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I'll tell thee:
processElement:
processElement:	[To GONERIL]
processElement:
processElement:	Life and death! I am ashamed
processElement:	That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
processElement:	That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
processElement:	Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
processElement:	The untented woundings of a father's curse
processElement:	Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
processElement:	Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
processElement:	And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
processElement:	To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
processElement:	Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
processElement:	Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
processElement:	When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
processElement:	She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
processElement:	That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
processElement:	I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
processElement:	I warrant thee.

processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
processElement:	To the great love I bear you,--
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
processElement:	with thee.
processElement:	A fox, when one has caught her,
processElement:	And such a daughter,
processElement:	Should sure to the slaughter,
processElement:	If my cap would buy a halter:
processElement:	So the fool follows after.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
processElement:	'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
processElement:	At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
processElement:	Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
processElement:	He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
processElement:	And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Well, you may fear too far.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Safer than trust too far:
processElement:	Let me still take away the harms I fear,
processElement:	Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
processElement:	What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
processElement:	If she sustain him and his hundred knights
processElement:	When I have show'd the unfitness,--
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:		                  How now, Oswald!
processElement:	What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Yes, madam.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Take you some company, and away to horse:
processElement:	Inform her full of my particular fear;
processElement:	And thereto add such reasons of your own
processElement:	As may compact it more. Get you gone;
processElement:	And hasten your return.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:		  No, no, my lord,
processElement:	This milky gentleness and course of yours
processElement:	Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
processElement:	You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
processElement:	Than praised for harmful mildness.
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
processElement:	Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Nay, then--
processElement:
processElement:ALBANY	Well, well; the event.

processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
processElement:	Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
processElement:	know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
processElement:	If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
processElement:

processElement:	your letter.

processElement:
processElement:	the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
processElement:	the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
processElement:	eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
processElement:	the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
processElement:	standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
processElement:	tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
processElement:	hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
processElement:	body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
processElement:	But mice and rats, and such small deer,
processElement:	Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
processElement:	Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	What, hath your grace no better company?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
processElement:	Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
processElement:	That it doth hate what gets it.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
processElement:	To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
processElement:	Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
processElement:	And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
processElement:	Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
processElement:	And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	First let me talk with this philosopher.
processElement:	What is the cause of thunder?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
processElement:	What is your study?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Let me ask you one word in private.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Importune him once more to go, my lord;
processElement:	His wits begin to unsettle.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Canst thou blame him?
processElement:
processElement:	[Storm still]
processElement:
processElement:	His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
processElement:	He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
processElement:	Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
processElement:	I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
processElement:	Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
processElement:	But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
processElement:	No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
processElement:	The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
processElement:	I do beseech your grace,--
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, cry your mercy, sir.
processElement:	Noble philosopher, your company.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Tom's a-cold.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Come let's in all.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	                  This way, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	With him;
processElement:	I will keep still with my philosopher.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Take him you on.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Come, good Athenian.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	No words, no words: hush.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,

processElement:	[Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND]
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
processElement:	gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
processElement:	of.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I now perceive, it was not altogether your
processElement:	brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
processElement:	but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
processElement:	badness in himself.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
processElement:	be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
processElement:	approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
processElement:	of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
processElement:	or not I the detector!
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	o with me to the duchess.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
processElement:	mighty business in hand.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	True or false, it hath made thee earl of
processElement:	Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
processElement:	may be ready for our apprehension.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will
processElement:	stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
processElement:	my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
processElement:	between that and my blood.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
processElement:	dearer father in my love.

processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Here is better than the open air; take it
processElement:	thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
processElement:	addition I can: I will not be long from you.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	All the power of his wits have given way to his
processElement:	impatience: the gods reward your kindness!
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Frateretto calls me; and tells me
processElement:	Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
processElement:	Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
processElement:	gentleman or a yeoman?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	A king, a king!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
processElement:	for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
processElement:	before him.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	To have a thousand with red burning spits
processElement:	Come hissing in upon 'em,--
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	The foul fiend bites my back.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
processElement:	horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
processElement:
processElement:	[To EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	   Look, where he stands and glares!
processElement:	Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
processElement:	Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
processElement:
processElement:Fool	   Her boat hath a leak,
processElement:	And she must not speak
processElement:	Why she dares not come over to thee.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
processElement:	nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
processElement:	white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
processElement:	food for thee.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
processElement:	Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
processElement:
processElement:	[To EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
processElement:	Bench by his side:
processElement:
processElement:	[To KENT]
processElement:
processElement:	you are o' the commission,
processElement:	Sit you too.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Let us deal justly.
processElement:	Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
processElement:	Thy sheep be in the corn;
processElement:	And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
processElement:	Thy sheep shall take no harm.
processElement:	Pur! the cat is gray.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
processElement:	oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
processElement:	poor king her father.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	She cannot deny it.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
processElement:	What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
processElement:	Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
processElement:	False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Bless thy five wits!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
processElement:	That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,
processElement:	They'll mar my counterfeiting.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
processElement:	Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
processElement:	Be thy mouth or black or white,
processElement:	Tooth that poisons if it bite;
processElement:	Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
processElement:	Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
processElement:	Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
processElement:	Tom will make them weep and wail:
processElement:	For, with throwing thus my head,
processElement:	Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
processElement:	Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
processElement:	fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
processElement:	about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
processElement:	makes these hard hearts?
processElement:
processElement:	[To EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
processElement:	do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
processElement:	say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
processElement:	so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	And I'll go to bed at noon.
processElement:
processElement:	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
processElement:	I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
processElement:	There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
processElement:	And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
processElement:	Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
processElement:	If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
processElement:	With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
processElement:	Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
processElement:	And follow me, that will to some provision
processElement:	Give thee quick conduct.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Oppressed nature sleeps:
processElement:	This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
processElement:	Which, if convenience will not allow,
processElement:	Stand in hard cure.
processElement:
processElement:	[To the Fool]
processElement:
processElement:	Come, help to bear thy master;
processElement:	Thou must not stay behind.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Come, come, away.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt all but EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	When we our betters see bearing our woes,
processElement:	We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
processElement:	Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
processElement:	Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
processElement:	But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
processElement:	When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
processElement:	How light and portable my pain seems now,
processElement:	When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
processElement:	He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
processElement:	Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
processElement:	When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
processElement:	In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
processElement:	What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!

processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt some of the Servants]

processElement:REGAN	Hang him instantly.
processElement:
processElement:GONERIL	Pluck out his eyes.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
processElement:	sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
processElement:	upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
processElement:	beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
processElement:	a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
processElement:	like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
processElement:	betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my

processElement:
processElement:	[Enter OSWALD]
processElement:
processElement:	How now! where's the king?
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
processElement:	Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
processElement:	Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
processElement:	Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
processElement:	Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast

processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three]

processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Bind fast his corky arms.

processElement:	You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Bind him, I say.
processElement:
processElement:	[Servants bind him]
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
processElement:
processElement:	[REGAN plucks his beard]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
processElement:	To pluck me by the beard.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	So white, and such a traitor!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Naughty lady,
processElement:	These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
processElement:	Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
processElement:	With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
processElement:	You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	And what confederacy have you with the traitors
processElement:	Late footed in the kingdom?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I have a letter guessingly set down,
processElement:	Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
processElement:	And not from one opposed.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Cunning.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	And false.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Where hast thou sent the king?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	To Dover.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Wherefore to Dover, sir?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Because I would not see thy cruel nails
processElement:	Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
processElement:	In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
processElement:	The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
processElement:	In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
processElement:	And quench'd the stelled fires:
processElement:	Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
processElement:	If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
processElement:	Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
processElement:	All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
processElement:	The winged vengeance overtake such children.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
processElement:	Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He that will think to live till he be old,
processElement:	Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	One side will mock another; the other too.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	If you see vengeance,--
processElement:
processElement:First Servant	Hold your hand, my lord:
processElement:	I have served you ever since I was a child;
processElement:	But better service have I never done you
processElement:	Than now to bid you hold.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	How now, you dog!
processElement:
processElement:First Servant	If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
processElement:	I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	My villain!
processElement:
processElement:	[They draw and fight]
processElement:
processElement:First Servant	Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
processElement:
processElement:	[Takes a sword, and runs at him behind]
processElement:
processElement:First Servant	O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
processElement:	To see some mischief on him. O!
processElement:
processElement:	[Dies]
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
processElement:	Where is thy lustre now?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
processElement:	Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
processElement:	To quit this horrid act.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Out, treacherous villain!
processElement:	Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
processElement:	That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
processElement:	Who is too good to pity thee.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
processElement:	Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
processElement:	His way to Dover.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit one with GLOUCESTER]
processElement:
processElement:	How is't, my lord? how look you?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
processElement:	Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
processElement:	Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
processElement:	Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN]
processElement:
processElement:Second Servant	I'll never care what wickedness I do,
processElement:	If this man come to good.
processElement:
processElement:Third Servant	If she live long,
processElement:	And in the end meet the old course of death,
processElement:	Women will all turn monsters.
processElement:
processElement:Second Servant	Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
processElement:	To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
processElement:	Allows itself to any thing.
processElement:
processElement:Third Servant	Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
processElement:	To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

processElement:	Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
processElement:	The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
processElement:	Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
processElement:	The lamentable change is from the best;
processElement:	The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
processElement:	Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
processElement:	The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
processElement:	Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man]
processElement:
processElement:	My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
processElement:	But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
processElement:	Lie would not yield to age.
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
processElement:	your father's tenant, these fourscore years.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
processElement:	Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
processElement:	Thee they may hurt.
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
processElement:	I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
processElement:	Our means secure us, and our mere defects
processElement:	Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
processElement:	The food of thy abused father's wrath!
processElement:	Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
processElement:	I'ld say I had eyes again!
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	How now! Who's there?
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
processElement:	the worst'?
processElement:	I am worse than e'er I was.
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	'Tis poor mad Tom.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
processElement:	So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	Fellow, where goest?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Is it a beggar-man?
processElement:
processElement:Old Man	Madman and beggar too.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He has some reason, else he could not beg.
processElement:	I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
processElement:	Which made me think a man a worm: my son
processElement:	Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
processElement:	Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
processElement:	more since.
processElement:	As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
processElement:	They kill us for their sport.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	[Aside]	How should this be?
processElement:	Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
processElement:	Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Is that the naked fellow?
processElement:Fool	If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
processElement:	danger of kibes?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ay, boy.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
processElement:	slip-shod.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Ha, ha, ha!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
processElement:	for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
processElement:	apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
processElement:	crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
processElement:	the middle on's face?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
processElement:	what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I did her wrong--
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	No.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Why?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
processElement:	daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
processElement:	horses ready?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
processElement:	seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Because they are not eight?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
processElement:
processElement:Fool	If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
processElement:	for being old before thy time.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	How's that?
processElement:
processElement:Fool	Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
processElement:	been wise.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
processElement:	Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter Gentleman]
processElement:
processElement:	How now! are the horses ready?
processElement:
processElement:Gentleman	Ready, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KING LEAR	Come, boy.
processElement:
processElement:Fool	She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
processElement:	Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt]

processElement:ACT II
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE I	GLOUCESTER's castle.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Save thee, Curan.
processElement:
processElement:CURAN	And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
processElement:	given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
processElement:	his duchess will be here with him this night.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	How comes that?
processElement:
processElement:CURAN	Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
processElement:	I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
processElement:	ear-kissing arguments?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Not I	pray you, what are they?
processElement:
processElement:CURAN	Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
processElement:	Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Not a word.
processElement:
processElement:CURAN	You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
processElement:	This weaves itself perforce into my business.
processElement:	My father hath set guard to take my brother;
processElement:	And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
processElement:	Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
processElement:	Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
processElement:	Intelligence is given where you are hid;
processElement:	You have now the good advantage of the night:
processElement:	Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
processElement:	He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
processElement:	And Regan with him: have you nothing said
processElement:	Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
processElement:	Advise yourself.
processElement:
processElement:EDGAR	                  I am sure on't, not a word.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I hear my father coming: pardon me:
processElement:	In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
processElement:	Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
processElement:	Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
processElement:	Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exit EDGAR]
processElement:
processElement:	Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
processElement:
processElement:	[Wounds his arm]
processElement:
processElement:	Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
processElement:	Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
processElement:	Stop, stop! No help?
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches]
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
processElement:	Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
processElement:	To stand auspicious mistress,--
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	But where is he?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Look, sir, I bleed.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Where is the villain, Edmund?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Pursue him, ho! Go after.
processElement:
processElement:	[Exeunt some Servants]
processElement:
processElement:		     By no means what?
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
processElement:	But that I told him, the revenging gods
processElement:	'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
processElement:	Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
processElement:	The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
processElement:	Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
processElement:	To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
processElement:	With his prepared sword, he charges home
processElement:	My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
processElement:	But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
processElement:	Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
processElement:	Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
processElement:	Full suddenly he fled.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Let him fly far:
processElement:	Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
processElement:	And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
processElement:	My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
processElement:	By his authority I will proclaim it,
processElement:	That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
processElement:	Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
processElement:	He that conceals him, death.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	When I dissuaded him from his intent,
processElement:	And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
processElement:	I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
processElement:	'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
processElement:	If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
processElement:	Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
processElement:	Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
processElement:	As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
processElement:	My very character,--I'ld turn it all
processElement:	To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
processElement:	And thou must make a dullard of the world,
processElement:	If they not thought the profits of my death
processElement:	Were very pregnant and potential spurs
processElement:	To make thee seek it.'
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Strong and fasten'd villain
processElement:	Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
processElement:
processElement:	[Tucket within]
processElement:
processElement:	Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
processElement:	All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
processElement:	The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
processElement:	I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
processElement:	May have the due note of him; and of my land,
processElement:	Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
processElement:	To make thee capable.
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants]
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
processElement:	Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
processElement:	Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	What, did my father's godson seek your life?
processElement:	He whom my father named? your Edgar?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Was he not companion with the riotous knights
processElement:	That tend upon my father?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
processElement:	'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
processElement:	To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
processElement:	I have this present evening from my sister
processElement:	Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
processElement:	That if they come to sojourn at my house,
processElement:	I'll not be there.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
processElement:	Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
processElement:	A child-like office.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	'Twas my duty, sir.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	He did bewray his practise; and received
processElement:	This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Is he pursued?
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	                  Ay, my good lord.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	If he be taken, he shall never more
processElement:	Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
processElement:	How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
processElement:	Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
processElement:	So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
processElement:	Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
processElement:	You we first seize on.
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	I shall serve you, sir,
processElement:	Truly, however else.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	For him I thank your grace.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	You know not why we came to visit you,--
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
processElement:	Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
processElement:	Wherein we must have use of your advice:
processElement:	Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
processElement:	Of differences, which I least thought it fit
processElement:	To answer from our home; the several messengers
processElement:	From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
processElement:	Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
processElement:	Your needful counsel to our business,
processElement:	Which craves the instant use.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	I serve you, madam:
processElement:	Your graces are right welcome.

processElement:	[Exeunt]

processElement:
processElement:
processElement:ACT II
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:SCENE II	Before Gloucester's castle.
processElement:
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Ay.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Where may we set our horses?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I' the mire.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	I love thee not.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Why, then, I care not for thee.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
processElement:	care for me.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Fellow, I know thee.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	What dost thou know me for?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
processElement:	base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
processElement:	hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
processElement:	lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
processElement:	glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
processElement:	one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
processElement:	bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
processElement:	the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
processElement:	and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
processElement:	will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
processElement:	the least syllable of thy addition.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
processElement:	on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
processElement:	knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
processElement:	thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
processElement:	rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
processElement:	shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
processElement:	draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
processElement:
processElement:	[Drawing his sword]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
processElement:	king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
processElement:	royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
processElement:	carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! help!
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
processElement:	slave, strike.
processElement:
processElement:	[Beating him]
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! murder!
processElement:
processElement:	[Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL,
processElement:	REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]
processElement:
processElement:EDMUND	How now! What's the matter?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
processElement:	flesh ye; come on, young master.
processElement:
processElement:GLOUCESTER	Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Keep peace, upon your lives:
processElement:	He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
processElement:
processElement:REGAN	The messengers from our sister and the king.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	What is your difference? speak.
processElement:
processElement:OSWALD	I am scarce in breath, my lord.
processElement:
processElement:KENT	No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
processElement:	cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
processElement:	tailor made thee.
processElement:
processElement:CORNWALL	Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
processElement:
processElement:KENT	Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
processElement:	not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
